Verimail.js
======================

Simply a kit for validating/verifying e-mails through javascript. Can prevent many common typos.

Current support:

    * Syntax validation (according to RFC 822)
    * IANA TLD validation
    * Text correction for the most common TLDs and email domains
    * Deny temporary email account domains such as mailinator.com

E.g. validating 'cool@fabeook.cmo' will result in a typo suggestion:

    Did you mean cool@facebook.com?
