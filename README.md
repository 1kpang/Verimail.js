Verimail.js
======================

Simply a kit for validating/verifying e-mails through javascript. Can prevent many common typos. Currently support:

    * Syntax validation
    * IANA TLD validation
    * Most common e-mail domains
    * Most common TLDs

E.g. validating 'cool@fabeook.cmo' will result in a typo suggestion:

    Did you mean cool@facebook.com?
